        <h3> PRANA YAMAS </h3>
        <p>Prana means vital force. Yama means control. Prana Yama thus means control of vital force. In beings the vital force operates through the process of breathing.
            Puraka, Rechaka and Kumbhaka are the three functions in the process of breathing.
            <ul>
            <li>Puraka means filling and indicates the inspiration which nourishes the system with Prana.</li>
            <li>Rechaka means emptying which indicates expiration.</li>
            <li>Kumbhaka is the retention or pause between inhalation and exhalation and between exhalation and inhalation.</li>
            </ul>
            In Prana Yama there are innumerable techniques to establish control over the vital force.</p>
