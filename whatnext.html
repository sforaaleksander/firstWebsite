                <p>
                    The Bodhisattva of Compassion,<br>
                    When he meditated deeply,<br>
                    Saw the emptiness of all five skandhas<br>
                    And sundered the bonds that caused him suffering.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here then,<br>
                    Form is no other than emptiness,<br>
                    Emptiness no other than form.<br>
                    Form is only emptiness,<br>
                    Emptiness only form.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Feeling, thought, and choice,<br>
                    Consciousness itself,<br>
                    Are the same as this.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    All things are by nature void<br>
                    They are not born or destroyed<br>
                    Nor are they stained or pure<br>
                    Nor do they wax or wane<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, in emptiness, no form,<br>
                    No feeling, thought, or choice,<br>
                    Nor is there consciousness.<br>
                    No eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind;<br>
                    No colour, sound, smell, taste, touch,<br>
                    Or what the mind takes hold of,<br>
                    Nor even act of sensing.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    No ignorance or end of it,<br>
                    Nor all that comes of ignorance;<br>
                    No withering, no death,<br>
                    No end of them.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nor is there pain, or cause of pain,<br>
                    Or cease in pain, or noble path<br>
                    To lead from pain;<br>
                    Not even wisdom to attain!<br>
                    Attainment too is emptiness.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    So know that the Bodhisattva<br>
                    Holding to nothing whatever,<br>
                    But dwelling in Prajna wisdom,<br>
                    Is freed of delusive hindrance,<br>
                    Rid of the fear bred by it,<br>
                    And reaches clearest Nirvana.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    All Buddhas of past and present,<br>
                    Buddhas of future time,<br>
                    Using this Prajna wisdom,<br>
                    Come to full and perfect vision.<br>
                    <p></p>
                    Hear then the great dharani,<br>
                    The radiant peerless mantra,<br>
                    The Prajnaparamita<br>
                    Whose words allay all pain;<br>

        <h2> Avalokiteśvara </h2>
        <article>
            <div class="avalokitesvara">
                <p>
                    Avalokiteśvara or Padmapani is a bodhisattva who embodies the compassion of all Buddhas. This
                    bodhisattva is
                    variably depicted, described and portrayed in different cultures as either male or female. In Tibet,
                    he
                    is
                    known
                    as Chenrezig, and in Cambodia as Avloketesvar. In Chinese Buddhism, Avalokiteśvara has evolved into
                    the
                    somewhat
                    different female figure Guanyin, also known in Japan as Kanzeon or Kannon. In Nepal Mandal this
                    figure
                    is
                    known
                    as Jana Baha Dyah, Karunamaya, Seto Machindranath.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The name Avalokiteśvara combines the verbal prefix ava "down", lokita, a past participle of the verb
                    lok
                    "to
                    notice, behold, observe", here used in an active sense; and finally īśvara, "lord", "ruler",
                    "sovereign"
                    or
                    "master". In accordance with sandhi (Sanskrit rules of sound combination), a+īśvara becomes eśvara.
                    Combined,
                    the parts mean "lord who gazes down (at the world)". The word loka ("world") is absent from the
                    name,
                    but
                    the
                    phrase is implied. It does appear in the Cambodian form of the name, Lokesvarak.
                </p>
                The earliest translation of the name into Chinese by authors such as Xuanzang was as Guānzìzài, not the
                form
                used in
                East Asian Buddhism today, Guanyin. It was initially thought that this was due to a lack of fluency, as
                Guanzizai
                indicates the original Sanskrit form was Avalokitasvara, "who looks down upon sound" (i.e., the cries of
                sentient
                beings who need help). It is now understood that was the original form, and is also the origin of
                Guanyin
                "Perceiving sound, cries". This translation was favored by the tendency of some Chinese translators,
                notably
                Kumārajīva, to use the variant Guānshìyīn "who perceives the world's lamentations"—wherein lok was read
                as
                simultaneously meaning both "to look" and "world". The original form Avalokitasvara appears in Sanskrit
                fragments of
                the fifth century.<br>
                This earlier Sanskrit name was supplanted by the form containing the ending -īśvara "lord"; but
                Avalokiteśvara
                does
                not occur in Sanskrit before the seventh century.
                <p>
                    The original meaning of the name fits the Buddhist understanding of the role of a bodhisattva. The
                    reinterpretation presenting him as an īśvara shows a strong influence of Hinduism, as the term
                    īśvara
                    was
                    usually connected to the Hindu notion of Vishnu (in Vaishnavism) or Śiva (in Shaivism) as the
                    Supreme
                    Lord,
                    Creator and Ruler of the world. Some attributes of such a god were transmitted to the bodhisattva,
                    but
                    the
                    mainstream of those who venerated Avalokiteśvara upheld the Buddhist rejection of the doctrine of
                    any
                    creator
                    god.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Sanskrit, Avalokiteśvara is also referred to as Padmapāṇi ("Holder of the Lotus") or Lokeśvara
                    ("Lord
                    of
                    the
                    World"). In Tibetan, Avalokiteśvara is Chenrézig, and is said to emanate as the Dalai Lama, the
                    Karmapa
                    and
                    other high lamas. An etymology of the Tibetan name Chenrézik is spyan "eye", ras "continuity" and
                    gzig
                    "to
                    look". This gives the meaning of one who always looks upon all beings (with the eye of compassion).
